This project segments customers, based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. 

Unsupervised learning techniques (Kmeans, Silhouette Score) were employed to identify groups of customers with similar behavior and characteristics.

The Customers were grouped into 5 clusters, as regards the correlation in clusters, between their Annual income and spending score. 

This information could then be used to develop a targeted marketing campaign.
